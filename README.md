# Domain of interest: Tourism Hostage
## Why are we interested?
We find Tourism domain  an interesting field since we think it’s a growing economic sector and according to the experts, now is the best moment to research and invest on it because thanks to new technologies as mobile apps and to the webs of collaborative economy as airbnb is possible to change the way we interact with the information since now its is more specific, easy to access and finally  is better for the users.
Also we think traveling to other countries or even cities of your own country is a good way to know new cultures and traditions favoring the cultural enrichment of people.

## Questions
- Are there any different patterns when renting a shared flat depending on the country? (Not only in price, but in the type of room, type of apartment, etc.)
- Is there a relationship between age and renting shared flats?
- Is the accomodation-sharing sector growing?
- How is the location of a flat related to the price?
- How did the appearance of accomodation-sharing affected the hotel industry?
